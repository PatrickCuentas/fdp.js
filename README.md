## Folder Structure
* *data*: All data files which are relevant for setup like languages files and example products and designs.
* *dist*: Ready-to-use bundles that you can use in your project.
* *examples*: Some examples to understand the setup of the product designer.
* *src*: All source files including HTML, JS, LESS files.

## Creating a custom build
### Install and start dev server

```
npm init
```

Start dev server.

```
npm run start
```

Now this will run webpack dev server and opens the examples folder in your localhost. 

Open one of the html file and edit the source of it by changing the file imports:

```
//Remove that...
<script src='./dist/js/FancyProductDesigner.min.js'></script>

//...and import theses
<link href="./dist/css/vendor.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<script src='./dev/FancyProductDesigner.js'></script>
```

From now on you can edit the source files and you should see any changes immediately. 

### Creating a production bundle
As soon as you are ready with your customization, you just need to run:
```
npm run gulp
```
This will create the necessary bundled files in the dist folder.
